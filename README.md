# Asset-Management# Vehicle Management System - Testing Strategy & Quality Assurance

## I. TESTING & QUALITY FRAMEWORK

### Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin Format)

#### User Registration & Approval Flow
```gherkin
Feature: User Registration and Approval
  As a new driver
  I want to register for vehicle access
  So that I can be approved to use company vehicles

  Background:
    Given the desktop admin application is accessible
    And the mobile app is installed and configured

  Scenario: Complete driver registration
    Given I am a new employee requiring vehicle access
    When I complete the registration form with all required documents
    And I upload a valid driver's license
    And I upload a clear ID photo
    And I provide emergency contact information
    And I submit the registration
    Then I should receive a confirmation email
    And my registration should appear in the admin approval queue
    And my status should be "pending"

  Scenario: Registration approval workflow
    Given I have a pending registration
    And I am an authorized approver
    When I review the submitted documents
    And all documents are valid and complete
    And I approve the registration
    Then the driver should be notified of approval
    And their status should change to "approved"
    And they should be able to access the mobile app

  Scenario: Registration rejection with feedback
    Given I have a pending registration with incomplete documents
    And I am an authorized approver
    When I review the submission
    And I find missing or invalid documents
    And I reject the registration with specific feedback
    Then the driver should receive detailed rejection reasons
    And they should be able to resubmit with corrections
    And their status should be "revision_required"
```

#### Vehicle Check-in Process
```gherkin
Feature: Vehicle Check-in Process
  As an approved driver
  I want to check in a vehicle
  So that I can begin my authorized trip

  Background:
    Given I am an approved driver
    And I have the mobile app installed
    And I am at a vehicle location

  Scenario: Successful vehicle check-in
    Given the vehicle is available for use
    When I scan the vehicle barcode
    And I am authenticated successfully
    And I take a dashboard photo showing fuel level
    And I enter the current odometer reading
    And the odometer reading is valid (higher than previous)
    And I complete the damage inspection checklist
    And I record any voice notes about the vehicle condition
    And I submit the check-in form
    Then the check-in should be recorded with timestamp and location
    And the vehicle status should change to "in_use"
    And I should be able to start my trip

  Scenario: Odometer validation failure
    Given I am performing a vehicle check-in
    When I enter an odometer reading that is lower than the previous reading
    Then I should see a validation error
    And I should be prompted to verify the reading
    And the check-in should not proceed until corrected
    And an alert should be logged for investigation

  Scenario: Critical damage discovered
    Given I am completing the damage inspection
    When I report critical damage to the vehicle
    And I take photos of the damage
    And I provide a detailed description
    Then the check-in should be flagged for review
    And the fleet manager should be notified immediately
    And the vehicle status should be set to "requires_attention"
    And I should not be able to proceed with the trip
```

#### Voice Note Processing
```gherkin
Feature: Voice Note Transcription and Processing
  As a driver
  I want to record voice notes during inspections
  So that important information is captured and searchable

  Scenario: High-quality voice note processing
    Given I am recording a voice note during inspection
    When I speak clearly about a maintenance concern
    And the recording quality is good (low noise)
    And I stop the recording
    Then the audio should be uploaded to cloud storage
    And transcription should begin within 30 seconds
    And the transcript should have >90% accuracy
    And key entities should be extracted (vehicle parts, dates, issues)
    And the note should be categorized as "maintenance"
    And the content should be searchable

  Scenario: Poor audio quality handling
    Given I record a voice note in a noisy environment
    When the transcription confidence is <70%
    Then the system should flag the note for manual review
    And the original audio should be preserved
    And a notification should be sent to the reviewing manager
    And the note should still be stored with available metadata

  Scenario: Voice note search and retrieval
    Given I have multiple voice notes in the system
    When I search for notes containing "brake problems"
    Then I should see all relevant transcriptions
    And the results should be sorted by relevance and date
    And I should be able to play the original audio
    And I should see the extracted key information
```

#### Geofencing and Violations
```gherkin
Feature: Geofencing and Route Compliance
  As a fleet manager
  I want to monitor vehicle locations and route compliance
  So that I can ensure vehicles are used appropriately

  Scenario: Authorized geofence entry
    Given a vehicle is on an authorized trip
    And there is an active geofence for the destination
    When the vehicle enters the geofenced area
    And the driver is authorized for this area
    And the time is within allowed hours
    Then the entry should be logged as authorized
    And no violation alert should be generated
    And the location should be recorded for tracking

  Scenario: Unauthorized geofence violation
    Given a vehicle is being tracked
    When the vehicle enters a restricted area
    And the driver is not authorized for this area
    Then a violation alert should be generated immediately
    And the driver should be notified via push notification
    And the fleet manager should receive an email alert
    And the violation should be logged with GPS coordinates
    And escalation procedures should begin

  Scenario: Late return detection and escalation
    Given a vehicle has a scheduled return time
    When the vehicle is not returned within 15 minutes of scheduled time
    Then an initial late return notification should be sent
    When the vehicle is 1 hour overdue
    Then the manager should be notified
    When the vehicle is 2 hours overdue
    Then emergency contacts should be contacted
    And the escalation should continue per policy
```

#### Service Interval Management
```gherkin
Feature: 10,000km Service Interval Tracking
  As a fleet manager
  I want to track service intervals automatically
  So that vehicles receive timely maintenance

  Scenario: Service due notification (500km warning)
    Given a vehicle has completed 9,500km since last service
    When the odometer reading is updated
    Then a service reminder should be generated
    And the assigned department should be notified
    And the notification should include service details
    And the alert priority should be "medium"

  Scenario: Overdue service blocking
    Given a vehicle has exceeded its service interval
    When a driver attempts to check out the vehicle
    Then the check-out should be blocked
    And the driver should see a service required message
    And the fleet manager should be notified
    And the vehicle status should be "maintenance_required"

  Scenario: Service completion and interval reset
    Given a vehicle has completed its scheduled service
    When the service record is updated in the system
    And the service includes required maintenance items
    Then the service interval should be reset to 0km
    And the next service due should be set to current odometer + 10,000km
    And the service history should be updated
    And the vehicle should be available for use
```

### Test Matrix Framework

#### Unit Testing Coverage (Target: >80%)
```typescript
// Example unit test structure
describe('OdometerValidation', () => {
  it('should accept valid odometer reading higher than previous', () => {
    const previousReading = 45000;
    const newReading = 45150;
    const result = validateOdometerReading(newReading, previousReading);
    expect(result.isValid).toBe(true);
    expect(result.errors).toHaveLength(0);
  });

  it('should reject odometer reading lower than previous', () => {
    const previousReading = 45000;
    const newReading = 44950;
    const result = validateOdometerReading(newReading, previousReading);
    expect(result.isValid).toBe(false);
    expect(result.errors).toContain('Reading cannot be lower than previous reading');
  });

  it('should flag unusually high odometer increase', () => {
    const previousReading = 45000;
    const newReading = 47000; // 2000km increase
    const result = validateOdometerReading(newReading, previousReading);
    expect(result.isValid).toBe(true);
